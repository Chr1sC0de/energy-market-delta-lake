        report_purpose='\n\nThis report is available to Participants for use in settlement for off-market hedge contracts. Potentially it is also useable as\nbenchmark price of gas in contract negotiations. Traders may wish to user the report to get a daily perspective of the value of\ngas in a day.\n\nThis report can be read in conjunction with INT041 which relates to the actual market ex ante prices and the calculated\n"reference prices".\n\nThis report provides a weighted average daily price based on the total imbalance and deviation payments.\n\nThe report provides another perspective of the market pricing of gas. Again these average prices are only for information and\nanalysis purposes and are not used in the actual settlement of the gas day.\n\nEach report contains the:\n- gas date\n- weighted average daily price for imbalance and deviation (GST exclusive)\n- date and time when the report was produced\n\nThe report should contain one row representing each gas day in a month. Therefore in a month consisting of 30 days, the user\ncan expect to see 30 rows of data.\n',
